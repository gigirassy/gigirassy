Hi, I'm Nune.
My profile is a huge mess. I'm passionate about anarchy, Transformers Animated Blitzwing, and preservation.
Here are some of my most notable (or proud) projects:
* [My website, forked from Apollo](https://github.com/gigirassy/testingapollo/): I run it in a Docker container that hosts a static web server.
* [US Government Warrior Farm](Cloud-Init, Docker, Podman, etc configs for helping ArchiveTeam preserve the US Government in bulk.)
* [Kurl](https://github.com/gigirassy/kurl-link/): Lightweight, POST-based link shortener for personal usage)
